# Zillow_Web_Application

- Web application which gets the property information for given street, city and state by making a API call to Zillow.

- Server side is developed using PHP and makes call to Zillow API. Zillow returns the data in XML and I parse the data and pass it to front end using JSON. Hosted the PHP backend on Amazon Elastic Beanstalk [Cloud web Services] for deploying the application, scaling and monitoring the performance of application.

- Used JQuery AJAX calls to communicate between the front end and the PHP.

- Bootstrap framework was used to develop a pleasing UI along with HTML5,CSS3, JQuery.

- Implemented Facebook mashup using Facebook API- Facebook Platform to allow users to post information on their profile.

- Responsive Web Design (RWS) to fit any device such as laptop, desktop, mobile, tablet.
